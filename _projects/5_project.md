# Computational Aerodynamics Group

From May to August 2022, I worked as a summer research student in the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies Computational Aerodynamics Group under Dr. David W. Zingg.

Throughout the summer, I divided my attention between 3 main tasks:

- **Performance analysis of the current generation multithreaded 2D and 3D flow solver Diablo with the older 2D flow solver Optima2D**
- **Experimenting with using low density automated hexahedral mesh generators to perform blocking**
- **MATLAB**: Implementing 1D meshing algorithm, multiple time-marching schemes, including explicit Euler and 4th-order Runge-Kutta, as well as 2nd and 4th order spatial difference operators.
