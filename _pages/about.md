I'm currently a student at the University of Toronto, in the Engineering Science: Robotics program. I love physics, simulation, and reinforcement learning. 

I've worked on designing AI accelerator SOCs @ Tenstorrent, doing robotics software for a research lab in Munich, where I also worked on novel reinforcement learning methods for robotic locomotion.

I am currently writing an undergraduate thesis about computer vision and 3d reconstruction for articulated objects, and developing software for autonomous drone flight. I'm always learning more about physics simulation, computer vision, and computer graphics.
