# Portfolio website
Working on learning React and making myself more employable at the same time.

## To build
`npm run deploy` configured to build for gh-pages and push to gh-pages branch on github.





## TODO

### Add support for French
Not only will this allow me to reach a broader crowd, but it will involve restructuring the website slightly and moving text to a central location, likely using JSON. (or hopefully yaml)

### Icons
Look into creating an icon font library containing all my icons. This is probably smaller and more performant than SVG while retaining quality and scalability.

For now, I'm using a mix of icons and svgs 
- fa fa-gears
- fas fa-graduation-cap / fas fa-user-graduate
- fas fa-plane
- far fa-lightbulb
- fas fa-code
- fas fa-code-branch
